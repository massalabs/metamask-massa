# MetaMask Snap for Massa

Welcome to the MetaMask Snap for Massa! This Snap enables seamless integration of MetaMask with the Massa layer 1 protocol, providing users with convenient access to Massa's features directly through MetaMask.

## Testing

The snap comes with some basic tests, to demonstrate how to write tests for
snaps. To test the snap, run `yarn test` in this directory. This will use
[`@metamask/snaps-jest`](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/tree/main/packages/snaps-jest)
to run the tests in `src/index.test.ts`.
